# PortfolioWebsite

A Wagtail website to share the projects I am working on, and general thoughts. 

## Overview

This project uses Django-Wagtail to create a portfolio website. The site includes a customizable landing page, static content pages, a blog with article support, and a contact page.

## Future Improvements

I have plans to make several improvements to the site including:
 * Adding pagination to the blog page
 * Adding a search feature to the blog page
 * Adding a filter feature to the blog page
 * Adding the ability to add tags to blog articles
 * Improving overall site accessibility
 * Improving the site's layout on mobile devices
